# Pico-PIO-USB

USB host implementation using PIO of raspberry pi pico (RP2040).

You can add additional USB port to RP2040.

ðŸš§ **This library is WIP. API may be changed drastically in future.** ðŸš§

## Examples

`capture_hid_report.c` is a sample program which print HID reports received from device.

```bash
cd example
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# Copy UF2 file to RPiPico and open serial port
```

Another sample program for split keyboard with QMK

## Resource Usage

- Two PIO
  - One PIO is for USB transmitter using 22 instruction and one state machine
  - Another PIO is for USB receiver using 29 instruction and two state machine
- Two GPIO for D+/D- (Series 22ohm resitors are better)
- 15KB ROM and RAM
